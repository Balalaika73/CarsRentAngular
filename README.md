# Angular Car Showcase Project

This project is an experimental implementation of an Angular-based car showcase application. It demonstrates basic Angular concepts, including standalone components, HTTP client usage, reactive forms, and dynamic data rendering.

## Key Features

- **Standalone Components**: Uses Angular's standalone component architecture (no NgModules)
- **Dynamic Data Fetching**: Retrieves car data from a mock API (`testologia.ru/cars-data`)
- **Interactive Filtering**: Allows filtering cars by brand (Lamborghini, Ferrari, etc.)
- **Reactive Forms**: Implements a contact form with validation
- **Zoneless Experiment**: Attempts to use Angular without Zone.js (see known issues)
